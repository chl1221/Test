# Gelatin Penetration

This code quantifies the fluoresent intensity of bacteria within biofilm after the addition of a dye-encapsulated nanoemulsion to probe the interaction between the nanomaterial and the bacteria within biofilm matrix. The time-dependent z-stacking images was taken using a Nikon A1 spectral detector confocal with FLIM module.
